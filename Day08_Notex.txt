*****If you cloned a project, to get same latest code from github:
If branch name is master:
*git reset --hard origin/master
If branch name is main :
*git reset --hard origin/main



*Note:
This will reset your project.
It will delete if you have your own codes/notes
Be careful when you use it, since it will bring the same copy of the github code
