<a class="nav-item nav-link" data-test="addresses" href="/addresses">Addresses</a>

This element is a link. because is has a tag.
We CAN USE
5. linkText

6. partialLinkText

7. xpath
***There are 2 types of xpath
1. Absolute
2. Relative

Note: We should not use absolute for locating elements

***Locate the elements using relative xpath

<input type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="Email" data-test="email" name="session[email]" id="session_email">

//tag[@ANYattribute='Value of that attribute'];

Tag: input
Attribute: type, classs,....
Value : email, form-control,...

XPATH FOR THIS ELEMENT. USE ANY OF THEM
//input[@type='email']
//input[@class='form-control']
//input[@placeholder='Email']
//input[@data-test='email']
//input[@name='session[email]']
//input[@id='session_email']

When xpath return multiple elements, we can use index to get unique element
For example, //input[@class='form-control'] return email and password elements

(//input[@class='form-control'])[1] --->>> returns the email that is in the first index
(//input[@class='form-control'])[2] --->>> returns the password that is in the second index

NOTE: If there are multiple match, findElement will give the first element by default.

*****Which locator do you prefer to use?
-I prefer to use id.
*****Why?
-Because id is unique.
*****What if id is not unique?
-Well, id normally should be unique. Dev may assign not unique id by mistake. In that case, I can use other locators such as name.

1.id
2.name
3.I don't use className, cause they are not usually unique
4.If there is no unique identifier such as id or name, then I write DYNAMIC RELATIVE XPATH
