What do you remember from the last class
Locators : Use to find eements from the website
	Id, name, className, tagName, linkText, partialLinkText, xpath, cssSelector

--In which order, do you use locators ?
	I use id first, cause there should have UNIQUE id. If thete is no id. then i use name-if is a unique name. class='btn-btnprimary' i usually don't use class because they are usually not UNIQUE. I don't use tags there are not generally unique. If the element is a link, then i prefer to use linkText or partialLinkText. Actually there is xpath i also prefer to use for lacations elements. I am good at writing dynamic xpath for the elements. I can write xpath for any element on the page.Even though xpath a little slower, it is safer to use,

indElement(By.Locator('value')) --> returns single element.(When multiple match, returns the first element). Returns WebElement, If there ius no match then throws nosuchelemetexception
findElements(By.Locator('value'))--> returns multuple elements. Return type is
List<WebElement>, if there is no match, returns empty List. Doesn't throw exception.
xpath : There are 2 xpath. absolute and relative
Absolute xpath : Navigation from the first parent to the targeted element 1 by 1. / is used.
Relative xpath : Navigating the elements using relative path. No need to go from parent to child 1 by 1. // is used
//tag[@attribute = 'value of that attribute']
There are multiple ways to write xpath.
Example website is : https://qa-environment.resortsline.com/
xpath using index.


---------------------------------------
//tagname[.='text name']
//h2[.='Welcome To Our Hotel']
This is used to locate the texts with SPECIFIC tag this combnation can be used to lacete the text on the page We have to pass complete text inside ' '
---------------------------------------
//*[.='text name']
//*[.='Welcome To Our Hotel']
* = ANY
This is used to locate the texts with ANY tag this combnation can be used to lacete the text on the page We have to pass complete text inside ' '  This is used to locate a text on the page with ANY TAG OR ATTRIBUTE
* -->> for any tag
. -->> for any attribute
--------------------------------------
-->>Just memorise this one //tag[@attribute = 'value']
-------------------------------------------
//*[(text()='text name’)]
//a[.='Resortsline']
* = ANY
This is used to locate the texts with ANY tag this combnation can be used to lacete the text on the page We have to pass complete text inside ' '  This is used to locate a text on the page with ANY TAG OR ATTRIBUTE
---------------------------------------
//*[contains(text(),'piece of text’)];
//*[contains(text(),'Welcome To Our H')]
* = ANY
This is used to locate the texts with ANY tag this combnation can be used to lacete the text on the page We CAN pass complete or PARTIAL text inside ' '  This is used to locate a text on the page with ANY TAG OR ATTRIBUTE

---------------------------------------
//tag[contains(@attribute,'value')]
//input[contains(@id,'UserName')]
This is used to locate especially DYNAMIC ELEMENTS We use TAG, ATTRIBUTE, VALUE OF THAT ATTRIBUTE We can use the xpath to locate any element
What is the dynamic element ?
The element's id, class.. can change when the page refreses.Especially if there is number in the attribute value, then the number can change. This is less likely but can hapen
facebook.com --> create new account

---------------------------------------

--How can you handle dynamic element?

//tag[starts-with(@attribute,'value')] -->(//input[starts-with(@id,'u_')])[1] returns the first input whose id starts with u_
//tag[ends-with(@attribute,'value')] --> //input[ends-with(@id,'P7')] returns the elements who ends with P7
//tag[contains(@attribute,'value')] --> //(input[contains(@id,'u_')])[1]
//*[starts-with(@attribute,'value')] -->(//*[starts-with(@id,'u_')])[1] returns any tag whose id starts with u_
//*[contains(@attribute,'value')] -->//*[contains(@id,'u_')] returns ANY tag whose ID CONTAINS u_ THIS IS THE MOST GENERIC
XPATH FOR LOCATING DYNAMIC ELEMENTS
Note that Dynamic elements are not common. We can rarely see dynamic elements on the pages.
